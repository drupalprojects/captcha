##Captcha Readme##

The DRUPAL-5 branch of CAPTCHA has been removed from CVS as new releases are 
made from HEAD.

The DRUPAL-5 branch continued to be vulnerable to the exploit posted in 
SA-2007-006 <http://drupal.org/node/114364>.

Please use one of the 5.x releases of CAPTCHA. The 5.x-1.0 release 
<http://drupal.org/node/110967> is functionally equivalent to the DRUPAL-5 
branch CAPTCHA (minus the bypass).
